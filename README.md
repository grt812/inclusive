Warning: this project is extremely undocumented and WIP

Make sure to pip install the requirements located in requirements.txt and follow the commands in https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/ and https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/ to create a virtual environment to run the app. You will also have to create a keys.py with Spotify API keys to access the spotify API.

It also looks like kaggle took down the spotify dataset, so you will have to add the tracks.csv found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IiJa-ocoEQuHnVM7a0X_tXCVIIEJRhR7/view to access it.

Made for the Designing and Inclusive Algorithm CTY class.
